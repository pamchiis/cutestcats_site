            <p class="headerParagraph">
                Cats are wonderful animals. Ever since I bonded with a cat for the first time back at the start of the pandemic, my life hasn't been the same. 
                I truly don't know what life would be like if I hadn't met my beloved cats. And for that, I want to write about each cat that has been part of my life,
                and celebrate their existences.

            <p>
                Moomi is my first ever cat. He showed up under my car one day during the pandemic. 
                He looked skinny and scared, so I left him a plate of food. 
                The day after, he went up to me as if he's known me forever. I was able to pet him, and he loved it.
                That's when I thought to myself: "I would die for these animals".

            <p>
                This is my second cat. She showed up at my father's farm, and has been the most loving cat since day 1. I admit, after the first few weeks of having Moomi,
                he did settle down a bit, and has learned that he doesn't need to let me pet him in order to get fed. So Moomi very rarely enjoys affection. Mimi however,
                she does not leave me alone up to this day. If I sit down anywhere near her, she will jump on my lap, and demand I give her affection. It's heartwarming,
                but she won't let me go!

                My third cat. Yeah, I guess I'm kind of listing them in order. Anyways, this one showed up one day at my front door meowing at the top of her lungs. It was a rainy day,
                and although my dad had already made it clear to turn the blind eye if any other cats get near the house, my heart could not stand the thought of a baby kitten alone in the rain
                begging for food. So I went outside, and gave her food. She ate all of the food so fast, faster than any cat I've ever seen, specially her size. After that she jumped on my shoulder and 
                laid down on it. Her immediate comfort with human interaction made me feel like maybe she must've been socialized already, and perhaps she got abandoned in front of my house. She is a really
                sweet cat. To this day she gets really excited when it's feeding time. I love her very much.

                My fourth cat. He showed up one day as I was feeding my three cats. He was already grown up, all my other cats showed up as they were months old, but he looked fully matured, so I was 
                concerned that he might've been a spicy feral cat. So as soon as he saw me, he ran away. I suspect he had been eating my cats' food for a while. I knew it was probably impossible to socialize him,
                but I tried anyways, because he seemed desperate for food. So every day, around the same time, I would put a plate of food in front of him. He would always be sleeping under an old car in my neighbor's house.
                Every day I would place the food bowl closer, and after around a week or so, he finally let me pet him. It's as if something clicked for him, because as soon as I pet him, he wouldn't leave my side.
                He was an amazing cat. He had the most squeaky adorable baby meow. He was also very fluffy and had beautiful fur. It hurts so much to say, but as of a few months ago, he's officially missing. It was very abrupt,
                and I still think about him often. I like to think that somebody saw him and thought he was a stray and decided to adopt him. But people in my area aren't very fond of cats. I'm just glad I was able to 
                give him love and take care of him for a while.

                It's quite difficult to explain, but somewhere in the timeline between mimi and pank's arrival, mimi gave birth to these two adorable calico's. Don't worry, Mimi has since been spayed, and these two
                found a loving home. I helped Mimi to take care of them. And they have grown up to be very loving and quirky cats. My friend Jaben adopted them and loves them dearly. They often hang around his desk while
                he works on his computer animations.

                This is my partner's cat. This is the fluffiest out of all the cats we have. She showed up one day as a tiny little fluffy kitten meowing around the house.
                My partner thought she was so cute, and couldn't help the thought of a tiny helpless fluffy cat being alone in the streets, so they took her in. She is extremely
                clingy, and loves affection. She is very explosive and loving. She kind of reminds me of my partner, and I feel like she absorbed a bit of their personality.

                This is my partner's first cat, before iggy showed up. She is the weirdest cat out of all the cats I know. She highly values her privacy, and is not very affectionate.
                She's kind of the complete opposite to Iggy. She also kind of looks like a wiggly plushie. However, she's not always a loner. Sometimes at night she cuddles up with my partner,
                and sometimes she gets in a loving mood and rubs on you.
